Software 
========

You'll need Python installed on your machine.

The tutorial assumes that you're using a Unix-like system, but there should be
no reason why (for example) it would not work for Windows users. 

You'll need a good text editor.

Other software will be used, but the tutorial will discuss its installation.

What you need to know 
=====================

The tutorial assumes some basic familiarity with the commandline prompt in a
terminal.

You'll need to know how to install software. Some of the examples given refer
to Debian/Ubuntu's ``apt-get``; you ought to know what the equivalent is on
whatever operating system you're using.

You'll also need to know how to edit plain text or source files of various
kinds.

It will be very useful to have some understanding of Python, but it's not
strictly necessary. If you've never done any programming, that will probably
be an obstacle.
