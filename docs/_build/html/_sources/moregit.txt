More key Git techniques

There are a few more key Git commands and techniques that you need to know
about.

.gitignore
==========

When you're working with Git, there are lots of things you won't want to push, including:

*   hidden system files
*   .pyc files
*   rendered documentation files
*   ... and many more

``.gitignore``,
https://github.com/evildmp/afraid-to-commit/blob/master/.gitignore, is what
controls this. You should have a ``.gitignore`` in your projects, and they
should reflect *your* way of working. Mine include the things that my
operating system and tools throw into the repository; you'll find soon enough
what yours are.

With a good ``.gitignore``, you can do things like::

    git add docs/
    
and add whole directories at a time without worrying about including unwanted
files.

Starting a new Git project
==========================

You've been working so far with an existing Git project. It's very easy to
start a brand new project, or turn an existing one into a Git project. On
GitHub, just hit the **New repository** button and follow the instructions.  

Combining Git and pip
=====================

When you used pip to install a package inside a virtualenv, it put it in a ``site-packages`` directory. When you're working on a package, that's not so convenient. On the other hand, cloning a Git repository doesn't install it on your Python path (assuming that it's a Python application). 

However, pip is Git-aware, and can install packages *and* put them in a convenient place for editing::

    cd ~/
    virtualenv git-pip-test
    source git-pip-test/bin/activate
    pip install -e git+git@github.com:washort/parsley.git#egg=parsley
    
The ``-e`` flag means editable; ``git+`` tells it to use the Git protocol; ``#egg=parsley`` tells it what to call it.

And now you will find an editable Git repository on installed at:

    ~/git-pip-test/src/parsley
    
which is where any other similarly-installed packages will be.
